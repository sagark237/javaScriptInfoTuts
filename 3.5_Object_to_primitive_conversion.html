        /* Object to promitive conversion: In this, we will look at how object converts to primitive and how to customize it. We have two purposes:
        1. It will allow us to understand what happens in case of coding mistakes, when this happens accidentally.
        2. There are exceptions, where such operations are possible, e.g. working on dates (Date objects).
        
        Conversion rules:
        i. All objects are true, no boolean conversion. There exist only numeric & string conversions.
        ii. The numeric conv happens when we apply mathematical functions, e.g., date 1 - date 2, gives time diff. b/w the two.
        iii. As for string conv, it happens when we output obj, e.g., alert(obj) and in similar contexts.
        
        Hints are there to decide which conv occurs:
        "string": when alert is used.
        
        alert(obj); //output
        another.Obj[obj] = 123; //using obj as property key

        "number": when we are doing maths.
       
       let num = Number (obj); //explicit conv
         maths except binary plus
       let n = +obj; //unary plus
       let delta = date1 - date2;
       let greater = user1 > user2; // lesser greater comparison

       "default": occurs rarely, when operator not sure what to expect, e.g., binary plus can concat as well as sum.
       let total = obj1 + obj2; //binary plus 'default' hint
       if (user == 1) {}; //obj == number default hint
       
        Symbol.toPrimitive: 
       obj[Symbol.toPrimitive] = function(hint)
       { //code to convert to string/number/default
        }
         */
        //example
        let user = {
            name: "John",
            money: 1000,
            [Symbol.toPrimitive](hint)
            {
                alert(`hint: ${hint}`);
                return hint == "string" ? `name: ${this.name}` : this.money;
            }
        };
        // conversions demo
        alert(user); //hint string -> name: "John"
        alert(+user); // hint: number -> 1000
        alert( user + 500 ); //hint default -> 1500

        /* toString/valueOf: If there's no Symbol.toPrimitive, it tries to find for "string": toString and for other hints, valueOf is triggered for maths, e.g.
        */
        user = { name: "John"};
        alert(user); // object Object
        alert(user.valueOf() === user); //true

        user = {
            name: "John",
            money: 1000,
            toString()
            { return `name: ${this.name}`;},
            valueOf()
            { return this.money;}
        };
        alert(user); //toString -> {name: "John"}
        alert(+user); //valueOf -> 1000
        alert( user + 500); //valueOf -> 1500
