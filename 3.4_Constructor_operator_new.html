        Constructor operator "new": At times we need to create many similar objects like multiple users or menu items and so on. This can be done using constructor functions and the "new" operator.
        Constructor function: are technically regular functions. There are two conventions though:
        1. They are named with capital letter first.
        2. They should ne executed only with "new" operator
        e.g.:
        */
       function User(name)
       { //this = {}; implicitly

       //add properties to this
        this.name = name;

        //return this; implicitly

       let user = new User("Jack");

       alert(user.name); //shows Jack
       alert(user.isAdmin); //shows false
       /* so let user = new User("Jack") is as same as:
       let user = {
        name: "Jack",
        isAdmin: false,
       };

       Constructor mode test, new.target: We can check if a function was called with new or without it, using new.target prroperty. It's undefined for regular calls and equals function if called with new
       */
       function User(name)
      {
        alert(new.target);
      }
      User(); // undefined without "new"
      new User(); //function User{..} with "new"

   // alert(john.name); // John
    
    /* Return from constructors: Constructors do not have a return statement. Their task is to write all to this and it becomes the result
    But if there is a return, it works like this:
    if return is object, then obj is returned instead of this
    if return is primitive, then it's ignored.

    Create new Calculator
    importance: 5
    Create a constructor function Calculator that creates objects with 3 methods:

    read() prompts for two values and saves them as object properties with names a and b respectively.
    sum() returns the sum of these properties.
    mul() returns the multiplication product of these properties.
    For instance:
    */
   function Calculator()
   {

    };

    alert( "Mul=" + calculator.mul() );
    
    /* Task 3
    Create new Accumulator
    importance: 5
    Create a constructor function Accumulator(startingValue).

    Object that it creates should:

    Store the “current value” in the property value. The starting value is set to the argument of the constructor startingValue.
    The read() method should use prompt to read a new number and add it to value.
    In other words, the value property is the sum of all user-entered values with the initial value startingValue.

    Here’s the demo of the code:
    */
   function Accumulator(n)
   {
    this.value = n;
    this.read = function()
    {
        this.value += +prompt("How much to add?",0);
    }
   }
    let accumulator = new Accumulator(1); // initial value 1

    accumulator.read(); // adds the user-entered value
    accumulator.read(); // adds the user-entered value

    alert(accumulator.value); // shows the sum of these values
