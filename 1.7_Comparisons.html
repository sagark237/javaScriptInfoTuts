         A funny consequence. It is possible that at the same time: 
         Two values are equal. One of them is true as a boolean and the other one is false as a boolean.
        For example:
    */   
let a = 0;
alert( Boolean(a) ); // false

let b = "0";
alert( Boolean(b) ); // true

alert(a == b); // true!
/*From JavaScript’s standpoint, this result is quite normal. An equality check converts values using the numeric conversion (hence "0" becomes 0), while the explicit Boolean conversion uses another set of rules.

Strict equality operator: === checks the equality without type conversion.
*/

/* Comparison with null and undefined
   Strict equality check === 
*/  alert(null === undefined); //false
    // non strict check ==

/* There’s a special rule. These two are a “sweet couple”: they equal each other (in the sense of ==), but not any other value.
    For maths and other comparisons < > <= >=
    null/undefined are converted to numbers: null becomes 0, while undefined becomes NaN.
    Strangeresult: null  vs 0
*/  alert( null > 0 );  // (1) false
    alert( null == 0 ); // (2) false
    alert( null >= 0 ); // (3) true null is converted to number as is treated as 0 so is true
   // An incomparable undefined
   alert( undefined > 0 ); // false (1)
    alert( undefined < 0 ); // false (2)
    alert( undefined == 0 ); // false (3)
/*  We get these results because:
    Comparisons (1) and (2) return false because undefined gets converted to NaN and NaN is a special numeric value which returns false for all comparisons. 
    The equality check (3) returns false because undefined only equals null, undefined, and no other value

    Task 1
    What will be the result for these expressions?
