           /* Logical operators: There are operators that can be used to check multiple conditions in different ways, i.e., how we want to use them:
           || (OR)
           && (AND)
           ! (NOT)
           ?? (Nullish Coalescing)
           Let's discuss each one by one, all of these operators give result as a boolean i.e., true/false:
           ||(OR): it works like OR gate of electronics if you're familiar with it. If not, it's alright will explain here.
           So, it works like:
           result = a || b;
           This  will result in true if anyone or both of the value from the conditions is non zero. False only if both are false or 0
           Output table:
           */
           alert( true || true );   // true
            alert( false || true );  // true
            alert( true || false );  // true
            alert( false || false ); // false
            // || finds the first truthy value:  Short-circuit evaluation, it will exit once it has the first truthy value
            let firstName = "";
            let lastName = "";
            let nickName = "SuperCoder";

            alert( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous"); // SuperCoder
            // let's see one more example with more than two conditions are passed
            let hour = 12;
            let isWeekend = true;

            if (hour < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend)
            {
             alert( 'The office is closed.' ); // it is the weekend
            }
            //another example for short circuit evaluation
            true || alert("not printed"); // not printed will not be executed as true is there
            false || alert("printed"); // here printed is executed as its the first no zero expression in the conditions
            /*&&(AND): it works like AND gate of electronics if you're familiar with it. If not, it's alright will explain here.
           So, it works like:
           result = a && b;
           This  will result in true only if both of the value from the conditions is non zero or true. False otherwise.
           output table:
           */
           alert( true && true );   // true
            alert( false && true );  // false
            alert( true && false );  // false
            alert( false && false ); // false
            //example with if
            hour = 12;
            let minute = 30;

            if (hour == 12 && minute == 30)
            {
            alert( 'The time is 12:30' ); // will run as both conds are true
            }
            //another example as && finds the first falsy value and then exits
            // if the first operand is truthy,
            // AND returns the second operand:
            alert( 1 && 0 ); // 0
          
            // if the first operand is falsy,
            // AND returns it. The second operand is ignored
            alert( null && 5 ); // null
            /* ! (NOT) operator: it works like NOT gate of electronics if you're familiar with it. If not, it's alright will explain here.
           So, it works like:
           result = !value;
           This  will result in true only if value is false, otherwise will return true
           Examples
           */
           alert( !true ); // false
            alert( !0 ); // true
            //double not gives the same value but returns as a  boolena, like it will (not of (not of (a) ) ). it works similar to Boolean()
            alert( Boolean(null) ); // false

            /*Nullish Colaesching operator '??': is used to get the first value that is defined or not null/undefined, if its not it will return the second operand e.g.,
            */
           let result,a=1,b;
            result = a ?? b //is as same as

            /* Comparison with || : it has the same precedence as || i.e. 3 higher than =,?.
            At first sight, it may seem that its similar to OR || returns first truthy value.
            But there's a difference:
            || returns the first truthy value.
            ?? returns the first defined value.
            e.g.:
            */
            let height = 0;

            alert(height || 100); // 100
            alert(height ?? 100); // 0
            /*About precedence, we need to add parenthesis as the precedence is hogher than =,?. If we are using these in expressions, then parenthesis is must to get the desired result. Let's see this with an example:
            */
            height = null;
            let width = null;

            // important: use parentheses
            let area = (height ?? 100) * (width ?? 50);

            alert(area); // will show 5000

            // without parentheses
            area = height ?? 100 * width ?? 50;
            alert(area); // will show 0 as mentioned below
            // ...works this way (not what we want):
            area = height ?? (100 * width) ?? 50;
            alert(area);//shows 0 as width null will be takes as 0 and ?? will return first value that is not null/undefined.
            /*Using ?? with && or || : Due to safety reasons, JS forbids using ?? with && or ||, so we need to use parenthesis so the precedence is clear. e.g.:
           let x = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error
           */
           let x = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works as returns 2 the second operand incase first is defined wuth &&

            alert(x); // 2
            //At the end, I will say, nullish coalescing operator ?? provides a short way to get the first defined value from a list of arguments passed
            // set height=100, if height is null or undefined
            height = height ?? 100;
            alert(height); // will show 100
