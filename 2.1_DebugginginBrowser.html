           /* Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. All modern browsers and most other environments support debugging tools – a special UI in developer tools that makes debugging much easier. It also allows to trace the code step by step to see what exactly is going on.
           The “Sources” panel
            Your Chrome version may look a little bit different, but it still should be obvious what’s there.

            Open the example page in Chrome.
            Turn on developer tools with F12 (Mac: Cmd+Opt+I).
            Select the Sources panel.
            The Sources panel has 3 parts:

            The File Navigator pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.
            The Code Editor pane shows the source code.
            The JavaScript Debugging pane is for debugging, we’ll explore it soon.

            Console: If we press Esc, then a console opens below. We can type commands there and press Enter to execute.

            After a statement is executed, its result is shown below.
            */
            // open console to see
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("value,", i);
