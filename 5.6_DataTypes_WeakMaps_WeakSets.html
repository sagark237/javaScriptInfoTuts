        /* WeakMap & WeakSet:
        WeaKMap: is fundamentally different int his aspect. The first difference between Map and WeakMap is that keys must be objects, not primitive values:

       console.log(weakMap); //WeakMap {{} => ok}
        /*WeakMap does not support iteration & methods keys(), values(), entries(), so there's no way to get all keys or values from it.
        It has only these methods:
        weakMap.set(key,value)
        weakMap.get(key)
        weakMap.delete(key)
        weakMap.has(key)
        We don't know if its values are cleaned by garbage collector or not, so methods that access all keys/values are not supported.
        Use case: additional data storage- If we are working with an object which 'belongs' to another or or even 3rd party library, would like to store some data associated with it, that should only exist while the object is alive - then WeakMap is exactly what's needed. We put the data to WeakMap, using the object as the key, and when the object is garbage collected, that data will automatically disappear as well. Example:
        */

    // main.js
    let john = {name: 'John'};
    console.log(countUser(john)); // count his visits
    john = null; // later john leaves us
    /* Now, john should be garbage collected, but remains in memory, as it's a key in visitsCountMap. We need to clean visitsCountMap when we remove users, otherwise it will grow indefinitely. Such cleaning is an issue in complex architectures.

    //cache.js

    Like Set, it supports add, has & delete, but not size, keys() and no iterations.
    Beaing 'weak', it also serves as additional data, for 'yes/no' facts. A membership in WeakSet may mean something about the object, e.g., weakSet tracks who visited our site.

    P.S. When a message is removed from messages, it should disappear from your structure as well.
