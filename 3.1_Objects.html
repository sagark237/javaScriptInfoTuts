           */

            Accessing properties: can be done in two ways:
            1. Dot notation: We use the object name with a dot followed by property name. This can be used to access single word properties names. We can add/remove properties as well using dot notation.
            e.g.:
            */
           alert(user.name); //shows "John"
           alert(user.age); //shows 30
           // -> Adding a property: This can be done as shown below:
            user.isAdmin = true;
            alert(user.isAdmin); //shows true

            // Deleting a property: This can be done using delete operator as shown below:
            delete user.age;
            alert(user.age); //shows undefined

            /* 2. Square bracket notation: We use them to access multiword properties. Let's see the example below:
            user.likes birds = true //shows syntax error
            */
           user = {};
           user["likes birds"] = true; //set/create the value
           alert(user["likes birds"]); //get the value // shows true
           delete user["likes birds"]; // deletes the property
           // We can also use a variable to pull or push a value into an object. e.g.
           let key = "likes birds";
           user[key] = false;
           alert(user[key]); //shows false
           // This gives us flexibilty to use some advance ways to pull data. Check the below example:
           user=
           {
            name: "John",
            age: 30,
           };
           key = prompt("what do you want to know about the user:\n name or\n age?",'name');
           alert(user[key]); // access by variable, shows name or age as per user input
           //here dot cannot be used:
           alert(user.key); //shows undefined

           /* Extra: Computed Properties: We can use square brackets in an object. That's called computed properties e.g.:
           */
          let fruit = prompt("Which fruit to buy?",'apple');
          let bag = {};
           // take property name from fruit variable and value is already computed there
           bag[fruit] = 5;
           alert(bag[fruit]);
           // Much more can be done with square brackets:
           fruit = 'apple';
           bag = {
            [fruit + 'Computers'] : 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
           };
           alert(bag.appleComputers); //shows 5

            name,
            age: 30,
           };

           //Property name limitations: At first, I will say that there is no specific limitation for naming properties. Like the reserved keywords (let, for, etc,) can also be used, can be any string or symbols or numbers (if 0 is used, '0' as this). The only limitation is this: __proto__. It's a special object will discuss later on. e.g.:
           let obj = {
            0: "test",
           };
           //both alerts access the same property
           alert(obj[0]); //shows test
           alert(obj['0']); //shows test
           // __proto__ example
           obj = {};
           obj.__proto__ = 5; // assigned a number
           alert(obj.__proto__); // shows [object Object]

           // Property existence test, "in" operator: is used to check if a property exists. Special case: if a property stores "undefined" buit exists right
           obj = {
            test: undefined
                };
            alert(obj.test); //shows undefined
            alert("test" in obj); // true property exists
