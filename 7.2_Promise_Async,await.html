    // Promise: The constructor syntax for a promise object is:

    let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // executor (the producing code, "singer")
    });
    /*The function passed to new Promise is called the executor. When new Promise is created, the executor runs automatically. It contains the producing code which should eventually produce the result. In terms of the analogy above: the executor is the “singer”.

    Its arguments resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JavaScript itself. Our code is only inside the executor.

    When the executor obtains the result, be it soon or late, doesn’t matter, it should call one of these callbacks:

    resolve(value) — if the job is finished successfully, with result value.
    reject(error) — if an error has occurred, error is the error object.
    So to summarize: the executor runs automatically and attempts to perform a job. When it is finished with the attempt, it calls resolve if it was successful or reject if there was an error.

    The promise object returned by the new Promise constructor has these internal properties:

    state — initially "pending", then changes to either "fulfilled" when resolve is called or "rejected" when reject is called.
    result — initially undefined, then changes to value when resolve(value) is called or error when reject(error) is called.
    So the executor eventually moves promise to one of these states:
    new Promise(extractor): state: 'pending', result: undefined
    ? resolve(value) => state: 'fufilled', result: value
    : state: 'rejected', result: error
    Later we’ll see how “fans” can subscribe to these changes.

    Here’s an example of a promise constructor and a simple executor function with “producing code” that takes time (via setTimeout):
    */
    promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        //the function is executed autuomatically when promise is contruucted

        // after 1 second signal that job is done with result 'done'
        //setTimeout( () => resolve('done'), 1000);
        setTimeout( () => reject( new Error('Oops')), 500);                                       }
                        );
        // promise.then(
        //     result => console.log(result), //shows done
        //     error => console.log(error) //shows oops
        // );
        promise.catch(console.log);
        
    //Catch is used for error handling
    /* Task 2
    Delay with a promise
    The built-in function setTimeout uses callbacks. Create a promise-based alternative.

    The function delay(ms) should return a promise. That promise should resolve after ms milliseconds, so that we can add .then to it, like this:
    */
    function delay(ms) {
        promise = new Promise( function (resolve, reject)
        {
            setTimeout( () => resolve('done'), ms);
        });
        return promise;
    }

    delay(3000).then(() => console.log('runs after 3 seconds'));
    
    /* Promise chaining: just like chaining functions, promise can be chained, i.e., The idea is that the result is passed through the chain of .then handlers. Let's see an example to return promises:
    */
    new Promise( function ( resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout ( () => resolve(1), 1000);
    }).then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); //1
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { //(*)
            setTimeout(() => resolve(result*2), 1000);
        });
    }).then(function(result) { // (**)
        console.log(result); //2
        return new Promise(( resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(() => resolve(result*2), 1000);
        });
    }).then(function(result){
        console.log(result); //4
    });

    //Rethrowing: If we throw inside .catch, then the control goes to the next closest error handler. And if we handle the error and finish normally, then it continues to the next closest successful .then handler.
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        throw new Error ("Whoops!");
    }).catch(function(error) {
        if(error instanceof URIError) {            
            // handle it
        }
        else { console.log("Can't handle such error");
                throw error;
            }
    }).then(function() {
        //doesn't run here
    }).catch( error => {
        console.log('The unknown error has occured:'+error);
    })
    
    //Unhandled rejection: If there is no catch then the script gives error in console log.
    new Promise(function() {
   // noSuchFunction(); // Error here (no such function)
    })
    .then(() => {
        // successful promise handlers, one or more
    }); // without .catch at the end!

    new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    
        throw new Error("Whoops!");
    }).catch(console.log);
