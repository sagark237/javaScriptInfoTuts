    /* Property getters & setters:
     Accessor properties are represented by “getter” and “setter” methods. In an object literal they are denoted by get and set:

    let obj = {
    get propName() {
        // getter, the code executed on getting obj.propName
    },

    set propName(value) {
        // setter, the code executed on setting obj.propName = value
    }
    };
    Smarter getter & setter:
    For instance, if we want to forbid too short names for user, we can have a setter name and keep the value in a separate property _name:
*/
    let user = {
    get name() {
        return this._name;
    },

    set name(value) {
        if (value.length < 4) {
        console.log("Name is too short, need at least 4 characters");
        return;
        }
        this._name = value;
    }
    };

    user.name = "Pete";
    console.log(user.name); // Pete

    user.name = ""; // Name is too short...

    //Imagine we started implementing user objects using data properties name and birthday, because it’s more precise and convenient:
    function User(name, birthday) {
    this.name = name;
    this.birthday = birthday;

    // age is calculated from the current date and birthday
    Object.defineProperty(this, "age", {
        get() {
        let todayYear = new Date().getFullYear();
        return todayYear - this.birthday.getFullYear();
        }
    });
    }

    let john = new User("John", new Date(1992, 6, 1));

    console.log( john.birthday ); // birthday is available
    console.log( john.age );      // ...as well as the age

    /* Prototypal Inheritance: In programming, we oftern want to take something and extend it. Example: we have a user object with props and methods, want to make admin and guest as slghtly modified variants of it. We'd like to re-use what we have in user, not copy/reimplement its methods, just build a new object on top of it -> Protypal Inheritance

    [[Prototype]]: In JS, objects have this hidden property [[Prototype]] (as named in specs) or references another object. That object is called a 'protype'. Wehn we read a property from object and it's missing, JavaScript automatically takes it from the prototype. In programming, this is called prototypal inheritance.
    The property [[Prototype]] is internal and hidden, but there are many ways to set it.
    1. Use special name __proto__, like this:
    */
   let animal = { eats: true, walk() { /* not used */ } };
   let rabbit = { jumps: true };
   rabbit.__proto__ = animal; // sets rabbit.[[Protoype]] = animal
   rabbit.walk = function () { console.log("Rabbit! Bounce-Bounce!"); };
   console.log(rabbit.eats); //true
   console.log(rabbit.jumps); //true
   rabbit.walk();
   /*eats is inherited by rabbit.
   Writing doesn't use prototype: Prototype is only used for reading props.

   Accessor properties are an exception, as assignment is handled by a setter function. So writing to such a prroperty is actually same as calling function. For that reason, admin.fullName works correctly
   */
  user = { name: 'John', surname: 'Smith',
    set fullName(value) { [this.name, this.surname] = value.split(" ");},
    get fullName() { return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`;}
        };
    let admin = { __proto__ : user, isAdmin: true};
    console.log( admin.fullneame); //John Smith
    admin.fullName = "Alice Cooper";
    console.log(admin.fullName); //Alice Cooper
    console.log(user.fullName); //John Smith
    animal = {
    eats: true
    };

    rabbit = {
    jumps: true,
    __proto__: animal
    };

    for(let prop in rabbit) {
    let isOwn = rabbit.hasOwnProperty(prop);

    if (isOwn) {
        console.log(`Our: ${prop}`); // Our: jumps
    } else {
        console.log(`Inherited: ${prop}`); // Inherited: eats
    }
                            }
